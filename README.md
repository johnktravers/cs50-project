# Final Project - CS50
##

-----
### Introduction

This is my final project for CS50. It is a web application that was created using Python with the Flask framework that features an interactive world map. 

The color scale indicates the level of risk of traveling to a country based on the world travel advisory. By selecting a country (either by clicking or selecting from the drop-down menu), one can see specific travel advisory information for that country, including entry and exit requirements, health and safety concerns, law and culture considerations, and climate information.

Enjoy!
