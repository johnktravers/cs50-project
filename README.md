# Final Project - CS50
##

-----

This is my final project for CS50. It is a web application that was created using Python with the Flask framework that features an travel advisory world map. The information is gathered from the Travel-Advisory.info API and the TuGo API, which provides travel advisory and culturally relevant information to travelers.

The color scale indicates the level of risk of traveling to a country based on the world travel advisory. By selecting a country from the drop-down menu in the navigation bar, one can see specific travel advisory information for that country, including entry and exit requirements, health and safety concerns, law and culture considerations, and climate information.

Enjoy!
